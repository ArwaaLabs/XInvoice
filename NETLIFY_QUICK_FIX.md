# ✅ Netlify 404 Error - FIXED!

## Problem
Getting 404 errors when navigating to routes like `/invoices`, `/clients`, `/settings` on your deployed Netlify site.

## Solution Applied ✅

### Files Updated:

1. **`netlify.toml`** - Added SPA routing configuration
2. **`client/public/_redirects`** - Created redirect rules (backup method)
3. **`vite.config.ts`** - Added publicDir configuration

### What This Does:
- All non-API routes (`/invoices`, `/clients`, etc.) → Redirect to `index.html`
- React Router (wouter) handles the routing client-side
- API routes (`/api/*`) → Go to serverless functions
- No more 404 errors! ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Commit & Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add Netlify SPA routing configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Wait for Auto-Deploy
- Netlify will automatically rebuild
- Takes ~2-3 minutes
- Check deploy status in Netlify Dashboard

### 3. Test Your Routes
After deployment completes, test these URLs:
```
https://your-site.netlify.app/
https://your-site.netlify.app/invoices
https://your-site.netlify.app/clients
https://your-site.netlify.app/settings
```

All should work now! ✅
